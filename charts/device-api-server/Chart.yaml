  Node-local GPU device state cache server for Kubernetes.
  
  The Device API Server acts as an intermediary between providers (health monitors)
  that update GPU device states and consumers (device plugins, DRA drivers) that
  read device states for scheduling decisions.
  
  Key features:
  - Read-blocking semantics during provider updates
  - Multiple provider and consumer support
  - Prometheus metrics and alerting
  - Unix socket for node-local communication
